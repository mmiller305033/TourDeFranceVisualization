        <h1> Cyclists Per Year</h1>
          We can kick off our analysis by looking at how the race has grown over time.  The Tour De France began in <b>1903</b> in the heart of Paris, with a meager <u>21 cyclists</u>.  Almost every year after, the race has continued to see a growth of participants and in <b>2021</b> we saw over <u>140 cyclists</u> competing.  The graph below showcases the total number of cyclists competing each year and shows the trendline to help us see how the race has grown in participants over time.

      <h1> Stages Per Year - By Stage Type </h1>
      The <b> Tour De France</b>, as you might've guessed, is a long race!  Every Tour De France, so far, has been at least 2400 miles long and is consequently broken up into multiple stages.  These stages are usually split up, categorically, to reflect the geological factors that are most prominent during that portion of the race.  For example, the <b>1903 race</b> consisted of 5 Plain Stages and 1 Mountain Stage.  Each year the route is different and it varies in both stage type and overall number of stages.
      Shown below is an interactive graph that displays the <b>Race Year</b>, <b>Stage Type</b>, and <b>Number of Stages by Type</b>

      <h1>Cumulative Stage Wins By Country</h1>
      As with any big sporting event, you're probably curious which countries are performing the best and how they compare to the competition.  Over the history of the Tour De France, one unsurprising statistic we see is the total number of stage wins by France.  <b>France</b>, year by year, was leading in stage wins, especially when the race was just getting its roots planted.  As time went on though, we began to see more countries participating in the race and subsequently more breadth in the countries getting stage wins.
